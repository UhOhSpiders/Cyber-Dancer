# DDR Clone To-dos

## Animation logic:
- Create clean note dropper function/threejs group
## Music:
- Write function to generate a switch statement of notes/moves based on any given midi track & set of animations
## Animation:
- Model character
- Animate moves
- Model/animate background
## Game logic:
- Scoring
    - If we're sticking with threejs note blocks, the score could be based off of the note block's world position when a player hits a key relative to the world position when the note is actually played by the midi track.
