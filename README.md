# DDR Clone To-dos


## General:
- Problem with using react for the menu system is that it must be forced to update the ThreeJsScene JSX element through passing a prop with state change to the useCallback dependency array. This forces the game to remount every time the menu changes.
- Refactor noteColumn & noteName variable names for easier readability
- Allow different backgrounds/targets/note blocks to be imported, while still having fallbacks
## Animation logic:
- Improve dance move logic
- Add hit/miss animations
## Animation:
- Model character
- Animate moves
- Model/animate background
## Game logic:
- Scoring
## Display logic:
- Make layout of threejs scene responsive
